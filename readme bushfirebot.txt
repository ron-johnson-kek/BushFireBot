# BushfireBot
Bushfirebot is a twitch chat bot used to be notified with useful wildfire/bushfire information as well as to easily access helpful and relevant information with commands. 

## Story 
The idea and motivation for this bot came a couple years ago while I was living in Australia. The 2019-20 bushfire season, also known as **Black Summer** was one of the most destructive seasons in years as over 18 million hectares was burned. [I was living in NSW which was left with 6.9% of the state burned and 27 peoples lives lost](https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/174823/Bush-Fire-Bulletin-Vol-42-No1.pdf). While I was fortunate enough to not be directly impacted by these fires, other than smoke for a few months, indirectly the damage to the country was felt. I had the oppurtunity to help out a cattle farmer whose farm was partially hit by one of these fires burning a couple of his tree lots losing him hundreds of thousands of dollars. I was working with a team of four other guys helping this farmer clear burned fence lines by cutting down treens and bucking fallen ones. Less than a year later in September 2020 the California and Oregon Wildfires burned seemingly unattended as the smoke made its way north to my hometown of Vancouver Canada. For over two weeks the smoke in Vancouver was some of the worst air quality in the world. 

These two experiences combined with my recent intrest in twitch and coding have inspired me to try my best at creating a twitch chat bot that can relay accurate and helpful information to users who may be affected by wildfires. 

As of Summer 2021 I will be working on making the bot relay wildfire information specifically in Canada. 

## Code
I am extremely new to coding with Javascript and most of my experience is from writing my first twich chat bot, ron__bot, in the last couple months. Tha being said feel free to see what I have done with this bot and to suggest how I might do things better. Again I am a noob with this stuff.
